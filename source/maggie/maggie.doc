     title describing case


  ****************************** LINE TYPE TWO ******************************

     nmesh  - number of grids

     iplt3d - plot3d flag
            = 0 no plot3d output
            = 1 plot3d files will be output for all grids

            = 1 yes

     nhole  - number of holes to be created

     nobtyp - number of computational-coordinate planes defining outer
              boundary points to be interpolated (zero if noutr = 0)


  ****************************** LINE TYPE FOUR *****************************
                (DATA FOR LINE TYPE FOUR REPEATED NMESH TIMES)

     lsrs - starting index in l-direction for the search of the overlap data

     lsre - ending index in l-direction for the search of the overlap data

     NOTE:  When the above parameters are set to zero, the search range
            will include the entire grid. (recommended)


  ****************************** LINE TYPE FIVE *****************************
       (LINE TYPES FIVE-EIGHT MUST BE REPEATED AS A GROUP FOR EACH HOLE)

     mesh      - current mesh number

     hole no.  - hole number in current mesh

     ihbtyp(m) - number of computational-coordinate planes in mesh m to define
                 hole in current mesh
                 (m = 1,nmesh)


  ****************************** LINE TYPE SIX ******************************
                                     nmesh
  (FOR LINE TYPE SIX, A TOTAL OF    SUM[IHBTYP(i)]    LINES NEED TO BE INPUT)
                                      i=1

     mesh - mesh number of mesh defining hole

     jh1  - starting location in j-direction for definition of hole 

     jh2  - ending location in j-direction for definition of hole

     kh1  - starting location in k-direction for definition of hole

     kh2  - ending location in k-direction for definition of hole

     lh1  - starting location in l-direction for definition of hole

     lh2  - ending location in l-direction for definition of hole

     NOTES:  1) ONE pair of the three sets of indicies (jh1,jh2 or kh1,kh2 or
                lh1,lh2) must have the same starting and ending values, since
                this line type defines surfaces that will (approximately) define
                the hole.

             2) The pair of indicies that has the same starting and ending 
                values should be negative if the outward pointing normal is
                in the direction of decreasing computational coordinate.

             3) the indicies are to be specified in terms of grid point
                values - note that this is in contrast to how outer
                boundaries are specified in line type 9.

             4) A shorthand for specifying the entire range of an index
                is to use 0 and 1 as the begining and ending values.

  ***************************** LINE TYPE SEVEN *****************************
     nlist  - total number of grids to search

     lst(m) - grid number to search for target cells associated with
              fringe points
              (m=1,nmesh)


  ***************************** LINE TYPE EIGHT *****************************
     iorph  - flag to set how orphan points (if any) are handled
            = 0  use value at nearest neighbor in donor mesh (zeroth order 
                 interpoltion)
            = 1  extrapolate from nearest neighbor in donor mesh
            = 2  extrapolate from nearest neighbor in donor mesh, unless
                 the resulting extrapolation coefficients fall outside the
                 generally acceptable range -0.5 to 1.5. for such points
                 the nearest neighbor is used instead (recommended)

     ihole  - flag to repeat search for stencil points if the first search
              turns up
              a stencil which contains one or more hole points (illegal stencil)
            = 0  do not repeat search
            = 1  repeat search in meshes other than the one in which the illegal
                 stencil was found. NOTE: only applicable if nlist > 1.
            


  ***************************** LINE TYPE NINE *****************************
   (LINE TYPES NINE-ELEVEN MUST BE REPEATED AS A GROUP FOR EACH GRID NEEDING
    BOUNDARY INFORMATION)
                                     nmesh
  (FOR LINE TYPE NINE, A TOTAL OF    SUM[NOBTYP(i)]    LINES NEED TO BE INPUT)
                                      i=1

     mesh - current mesh number

     jo1  - cell center starting location in j-direction for definition of
            outer boundary points to be interpolated

     jo2  - cell center ending location in j-direction for definition of 
            outer boundary points to be interpolated

     ko1  - cell center starting location in k-direction for definition of 
            outer boundary points to be interpolated

     ko2  - cell center ending location in k-direction for definition of 
            outer boundary points to be interpolated

     lo1  - cell center starting location in l-direction for definition of 
            outer boundary points to be interpolated

     lo2  - cell center ending location in l-direction for definition of 
            outer boundary points to be interpolated

     NOTES: 1) The shorhand convention of 0,1 for specifying the full range
            of an index, as described under line type 6, is also applicable
            to the specification of the outer boundary.

            2) The indicies specified under line type eight refer to cell-center
            grid; indicies in all other line types refer to actual grid. If
            the grid has (point) dimensions JDIM*KDIM*LDIM, then the
            corresponding cell center grid has dimensions JDIM-1*KDIM-1*LDIM-1.
            The outer boundaries created via this line type generally should 
            extend beyond the range of cell center dimensions, e.g. for a 
            J-boundary, the cell center boundary points should have values
            JDIM and JDIM+1 or 0 and -1. Maggie will extrapolate x,y,z 
            coordinates for these newly defined cell centers based on the
            local stretching rates in the existing grid, and then attempt
            to determine interpolation coefficients from another block based
            on these x,y,z coordinates. There may be situations, however, where
            the extrapolated x,y,z coordinates may be inappropriate (for example
            they may "punch through" a nearby solid surface or symmetry plane).
            In that case, an alternative approach is to set the indicies for
            the outer boundaries to be  JDIM-2 and JDIM-1 or 1 and 2, as 
            appropriate.  This alternative approach is less well tested in
            terms of usage in CFL3D. The bottom line is that acceptable
            outer boundary indicies are (for the J direction): -1,0 or 1,2
            and JDIM,JDIM+1 or JDIM-2,JDIM-1.
            

            As a specific example, consider the following:

            Say a particular block (say blk 2)  has (point) dimensions jxkxl =
            33x65x17. That means the cell center indicies are 32x64x16. 
            Furthermore, assume the outer  k-boundary (i.e. near the k=65 grid 
            point) needs to receive data from some other block. There are 
            already 64 cells in the k-direction, so the standard outer boundary
            definition would be to extrapolate the grid to create 2 layers
            of ghost cells at the outer k-boundary, with these ghost cells
            centers having indicies k=65 and k=66. Then the maggie input would be:

            OUTER BOUNDARY POINTS (CELL CENTER) TO BE INTERPOLATED:
            MESH       JO1       JO2       KO1       KO2       LO1       LO2
               2         1        32        65        66         1        16

            or using the shorthand 0/1 for the J and L directions:

            OUTER BOUNDARY POINTS (CELL CENTER) TO BE INTERPOLATED:
            MESH       JO1       JO2       KO1       KO2       LO1       LO2
               2         0         1        65        66         0         1


            If it is necessary to connect the inner k-boundary to another grid 
            (near the k=1 grid line), then note that the existing cell centers 
            start at 1, so the preferred method is to specify ghost cells
            -1 and 0. Thus

            OUTER BOUNDARY POINTS (CELL CENTER) TO BE INTERPOLATED:
             MESH       JO1       JO2       KO1       KO2       LO1       LO2
                2         1        32        -1         0         1        16

            or using the shorthand 0/1 for the J and L directions (be careful
            not to confuse the shorhand notation 0,1 with the ghost cell location
            -1,0):

            OUTER BOUNDARY POINTS (CELL CENTER) TO BE INTERPOLATED:
             MESH       JO1       JO2       KO1       KO2       LO1       LO2
                2         0         1        -1         0         0         1

      ----> NOTE THAT ON THE KMIN BOUNDARY, KO1 = -1 and KO2 = 0, NOT VICE-VERSA

     ihole  - flag to repeat search for stencil points if the first search
