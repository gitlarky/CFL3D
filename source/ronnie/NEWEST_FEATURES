1) Ronnie now supports 2 input file styles. The new style was added to 
allow user-specified search range on from side - this should
overcome some difficult search problems at the expense of additional
user input.

2) Ronnie has been modified to increase robustness when attempting
to determine interpolation data on coarser levels. In the past, the
search routines would sometimes fail on coarser levels, despite having
successfully determined all the corresponding stencils on a finer
level. Now, if the routines initially fail on a coarser level, ronnie
will set coarser level stencils by collocating fine grid data.

3) A preprocessor (preronnie) has been developed for ronnie. Operation 
of preronnie is similar to precfl3d: after compiling, type

preronnie <ronnie.inp

where preronnie is the name of the executable, and ronnie.inp is the
ronnie input file. Preronnie will then create or modify the parameter
file ron1.h as needed for the particular case, and will suggest whether
recompilation of ronnie is needed or not.

4) The file names created when diagnostic plot3d output is generated
(either automatically or by setting ifit<0) have been changed. The old
file names where fort.xx, where xx is the interpolation number. The
new file names are denoted by patch_p3d.xx. The new names avoid the 
limit on some systems of creating a file past fort.99.



The differences between the old and new styles are described below:

OLD Style:

shockg.bin_sngl
ronnie.out

NEW Style:

where: ioflag = 1 allows new input format as indicated below
              = 0 for the old input format (where all the "from"
                  blocks are on one line)
  
       itrace = -1....no tracing
              =  0....save trace from last cell only
              = +1....save trace from all cells searched so far 
                      (may give big file!)

       itrace .ne. -1 primarily intended for the code developer
